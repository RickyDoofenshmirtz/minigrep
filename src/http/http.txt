So, while TCP/IP provides the foundational protocols for network communication, 
HTTP operates at a higher level and specifically focuses on the exchange of hypertext-based content between clients and servers.

Exactly! You've got it. HTTP is a higher-level protocol that operates on top of the TCP/IP protocol suite. 
HTTP is specifically designed for the transfer of hypertext, which includes web pages, images, and other resources.

TCP/IP, on the other hand, is a lower-level protocol suite that provides the underlying foundation for network communication. 
It handles the transmission, routing, and delivery of data packets across networks. 
TCP/IP is responsible for establishing connections, breaking data into packets, managing reliability, and addressing devices on the network.

HTTP builds upon TCP/IP by defining the structure and semantics of messages exchanged between clients and servers. 
It specifies how requests and responses should be formatted, what actions to take based on different methods, and how to handle various status codes.

In summary, TCP/IP provides the fundamental infrastructure for network communication, while HTTP adds a layer of rules and conventions for exchanging specific types of data (hypertext) between clients and servers.
