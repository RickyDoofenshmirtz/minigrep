Tokio and Rocket are different libraries with distinct purposes in the Rust ecosystem.

Tokio is an asynchronous runtime that provides the foundation for building asynchronous, event-driven applications in Rust. 
It focuses on managing asynchronous tasks, scheduling I/O operations, and handling event-driven programming patterns. 
Tokio is commonly used for developing network servers, clients, and other asynchronous systems.

On the other hand, Rocket is a web framework for Rust that simplifies the development of web applications. 
It provides abstractions, routing capabilities, and utilities for building RESTful APIs and web services. 
Rocket includes features like request handling, routing macros, middleware, and request/response processing.

While both Tokio and Rocket are commonly used together in building web applications, they serve different purposes. 
Tokio provides the asynchronous runtime and I/O handling capabilities, 
while Rocket provides a higher-level framework for building web applications on top of Tokio or other asynchronous runtimes.

In summary, Tokio is a lower-level library focused on asynchronous programming and I/O handling, 
while Rocket is a higher-level web framework built on top of Tokio to facilitate web application development.
